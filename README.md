Served by Express, rendered via Pug, powered by some vanilla JS scripts on the front.


There was this game when i was a kid, where you need to find identical pairs hidden under blocks. 
You only see two blocks open at once, so you need to memorize correct positions to advance.

Update: added 2 player mode! Now you can compete with a friend real-time, see who can get more matches first.
